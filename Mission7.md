# Mission 7: Understanding and Preventing the Use of Breached Passwords

## 🚨 What is a Breached Password?

A breached password refers to a username and password combination that has been exposed in a data breach. These credentials are often leaked onto the internet, making them vulnerable to misuse by cybercriminals.

## 🔢 Why Breached Passwords Are Dangerous

Using breached passwords can lead to severe security risks, including:
1. **Account Takeovers** - Attackers can access your accounts if the same password is reused across multiple platforms.
2. **Financial Fraud** - If your financial accounts are compromised, you may face unauthorized transactions.
3. **Identity Theft** - Cybercriminals can impersonate you online, leading to serious personal and financial consequences.

## 🛠️ How Someone Could Use a Breached Password

1. **Credential Stuffing Attacks**:
   - Attackers take breached credentials and attempt to use them on multiple platforms.
   - Example: Using an email/password combo from a breached email service to access banking accounts.

2. **Password Reuse Exploitation**:
   - If you reuse the same password across multiple platforms, a breach on one site can compromise all others.

3. **Phishing and Social Engineering**:
   - Attackers may trick users into revealing more sensitive information by pretending to be a legitimate service.

## 🛠️ How to Check if Your Password Has Been Breached

1. **Use Have I Been Pwned**:
   - Visit [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
   - Enter your email or password to check if it has been involved in a breach.

2. **Check with Dashlane**:
   - Dashlane’s breach database allows users to monitor for compromised credentials.

## 🛔️ How to Prevent Using Breached Passwords

1. **Use Unique Passwords**:
   - Generate unique, strong passwords for every account.

2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords.

3. **Use a Password Manager**:
   - Tools like 1Password, LastPass, or Dashlane can help store and generate strong passwords.

4. **Regularly Update Passwords**:
   - Change passwords periodically, especially after hearing about a data breach.
